Any number of different accounts can each have a quantity of a certain fungible token.</p><p>By contrast, non-fungible tokens are unique and not interchangeable. Therefore, only one account can own a specific NFT at one time.</p><p>The term &quot;NFT&quot; is often misused when assets are represented on blockchains, and is often confused with a fungible token. Make sure that you understand the difference.</p><p>For more information about types of tokens, see <a href="https://docs.tezos.com/architecture/tokens" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Tokens</a> on docs.tezos.com.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-fa2-standard" tabindex="-1">What is the FA2 standard? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-the-fa2-standard" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is the FA2 standard?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>FA2 is a standard interface for tokens on Tezos. It supports several different token types, including fungible and non-fungible tokens.</p><p>Adhering to the FA2 standard allows developers to create new types of tokens while ensuring that the tokens work with existing wallets and applications. The FA2 standard leaves enough freedom for developers to define rules for transferring tokens and for how tokens behave.</p><p>For more information about FA2 tokens, see <a href="https://docs.tezos.com/architecture/tokens/FA2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">FA2 tokens</a> on docs.tezos.com.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-smartpy-fa2-library" tabindex="-1">What is the SmartPy FA2 library? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-the-smartpy-fa2-library" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is the SmartPy FA2 library?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The SmartPy FA2 library provides classes and other tools to simplify creating FA2-compliant tokens in the SmartPy language. You create a contract that inherits from a base class in the library to select a kind of token (fungible, single-asset, or non-fungible). Then you inherit mixins to customize how the token works.</p><p>For more information about the SmartPy FA2 library, see <a href="/previews/smartpy/casting-scenarios/manual/libraries/FA2-lib/overview">FA2 lib</a>.</p><h2 id="tutorial-application" tabindex="-1">Tutorial application <a class="header-anchor" href="#tutorial-application" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Tutorial application&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In this tutorial, you use the SmartPy FA2 library to create a contract that manages multiple fungible tokens. You add automated tests to the token, deploy it to a local sandbox, customize it further, and deploy it to a test network. Finally, you work with the token in your own Tezos wallet.</p><p>The completed smart contracts are available here: <a href="https://github.com/trilitech/tutorial-applications/tree/main/smartpy_fa2_fungible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/trilitech/tutorial-applications/tree/main/smartpy_fa2_fungible</a></p><p>When you&#39;re ready, move to <a href="/previews/smartpy/casting-scenarios/tutorials/fa2-fungible/basic-fa2-token">Part 1: Setting up a simple FA2 token</a>.</p>',23)]))}const f=e(i,[["render",n]]);export{d as __pageData,f as default};
