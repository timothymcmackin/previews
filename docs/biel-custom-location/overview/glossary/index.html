In particular, the chain whose millionth block had hash BKtC4QCWoF73kxLj773vFpQuuwrnye6PS7T1aM3XEPvFXiQbNu7WeightSee fitness.Protocol termsAccuserWhen a delegate attempts double signing (or when it tries to abuse the network in another similar way), another delegate can make an accusation, by providing evidence of the offense. The delegate injecting the accusation in a newly baked block is called the accuser.The accuser is awarded some funds from the security deposit of the accused.When using Octez, accusation operations are emitted by the accuser daemon. Note that this daemon is not associated to a delegate an accuser can provide proof of the double signing to be awarded part of the double signer’s deposit – see Slashing.Failing NoopThe Failingnoop operation implements a No-op, which always fails at application time, and should never appear in applied blocks. This operation allows end-users to sign arbitrary messages which have no computational semantics.FeeTo ensure responsible use of computation resources of other nodes, and also to encourage active participation in the consensus protocol, users pay fees to bakers for including their operations in blocks. For example, fees are paid to a baker for operations such as a transaction or a revelation of a public key.Currently, only manager operationsrequire collecting fees from its sender account.See also burn.GasA measure of the number of elementary steps performed during the execution of a smart contract. Gas is used to measure how much computing power is used to execute a smart contract.Implicit accountSee user account.Layer 1The primary blockchain i.e. the Tezos chain. Within any blockchain ecosystem, Layer 1 (L1) refers to the main chain to which side chains, rollups, or other protocols connect and settle to. The Layer 1 chain is deemed to be most secure, since it has the most value (or stake) tied to it, and be most decentralized and censorship resistant. However, transaction space is limited leading to low throughput and possibly high transaction costs. See Layer 2.Layer 2Layer 2 (L2) includes sidechains, rollups, payment channels, etc. that batch their transactions and write to the Layer 1 chain. By processing transactions on layer 2 networks, greater scalability in speed and throughput can be achieved by the ecosystem overall, since the number of transactions the Layer 1 can process directly is limited. By cementing transactions from a L2 to L1, the security of the L1 chain backs those operations. Currently, Layer 2 solutions on Tezos are built as smart rollups.MichelsonThe built-in language used by a smart contract.Minimal stakeAn amount of tez (e.g., 6000ꜩ) serving as a minimal amount for a delegate to have baking rights and voting rights in a cycle.Operation kindsThe main kinds of operations in the protocol are transactions (to transfer funds or to execute smart contracts), accusations, activations, delegations, attestations, and originations. For the full list of operations, see Blocks and Operations.Originated accountSee smart contract.OriginationA manager operation whose purpose is to create – that is, to deploy – a smart contract on the Tezos blockchain.PVMA PVM (Proof-generating Virtual Machine) is a reference implementation for a device on top of which a smart rollup can be executed. This reference implementation is part of the economic protocol and is the unique source of truth regarding the semantics of rollups. The PVM is able to produce proofs enforcing this truth. This ability is used during the final step of a refutation game.Refutation gameA process by which the economic protocol solves a conflict between two rollup committers. Note that the refutation mechanism used in Tezos smart rollups corresponds to the notion of fraud proofs used in other blockchain/Layer 2 ecosystems.Refutation periodWhen the first rollup commitment for a rollup commitment period is published, a refutation period of two weeks starts to allow this commitment to be challenged.Rolldeprecated; see minimal stake.Rollup commitmentA claim that the interpretation of all rollup inbox messages published during a given period, and applied on the state of a parent rollup commitment, led to a given new state by performing a given number of execution steps of the PVM.Rollup commitment periodA period of roughly 15 minutes during which all rollup inboxmessages must be processed by the rollup node state to compute a rollup commitment. A commitment must be published for each commitment period.Rollup committerA user account that has published and made a deposit on a rollup commitment.Rollup inboxA sequence of messages from the Layer 1 to all the smart rollups. The contents of the inbox are determined by the consensus of the economic protocol.Rollup nodeA daemon required for deploying and operating smart rollups. The rollup node is responsible for making the rollup progress by publishing rollup commitments and by playing refutation games.Rollup outboxA sequence of messages from a smart rollup to the Layer 1. Messages are smart contract calls, potentially containing tickets. These calls can be triggered only when the related rollup commitment is cemented (hence, at least two weeks after the actual execution of the operation).RoundAn attempt to reach consensus on a block at a given level. A round is represented by an index, starting with 0. Each round corresponds to a time span. A baker with baking rights at a given round is only allowed to bake during the round’s corresponding time span. Baking outside of one’s designated round results in an invalid block.Smart contractAccount which is associated to a Michelson script. They are created with an explicit origination operation and are therefore sometimes called originated accounts. The address of a smart contract always starts with the letters KT1.Smart RollupSmart rollups constitute a Layer 2 solution that can be used to deploy either a general-purpose polyvalent Layer 2 blockchain (e.g., an EVM-compatible one), or an application-specific DApp. See Smart Optimistic Rollups.StakerA user account that made a security deposit. The user account must have set a delegate. The security deposit accrues to the stake of the user account’s delegate and is subject to slashing in case the delegate misbehaves – see Slashing.TezA unit of the cryptocurrency native to a Tezos chain, such as in “I sent you 2 tez.” Tez is invariable. It is not capitalized except at the beginning of a sentence or when you would otherwise capitalize a noun. See also XTZ.TransactionAn operation to transfer tez between two accounts, or to run the code of a smart contract.User accountAn account that is linked to a public key. Contrary to a smart contract, a user account cannot include a script and it cannot reject incoming transactions. User accounts are sometimes called “implicit accounts”.If registered, a user account can act as a delegate.The address of a user account always starts with the letters tz followed by 1, 2, 3, or 4 (depending on the signature scheme) and finally the hash of the public key. See Accounts and addresses for a more detailed explanation on addresses.Validation passAn index (a natural number) associated with a particular kind of operations, allowing to group them into classes. Validation passes enable prioritizing the validation and application of certain classes of operations.Voting periodAny of the proposal, exploration, cooldown, promotion or adoption stages in the voting procedure when amending the economic protocol.Voting powerThe amount of tokens that determines a delegate’s weight in the voting process. A delegate’s voting power is computed from the delegate’s own tokens and the sum of tokens delegated to it. See Voting Power for details.Voting listingsThe list calculated at the beginning of each voting period that contains the staking balance (in number of mutez) of each delegate that owns more than the minimal stake at that moment. For each delegate, the voting listings reflect the weight of the vote emitted by the delegate when amending the economic protocol.XTZXTZ, tez, or ꜩ (\ua729, “Latin small letter tz”) is the native currency of Tezos.“XTZ” is an ISO-4217-compatible code for representing tez on the most economically relevant Tezos chain. Unless there is a very specific reason to use an ISO code for it, the term tez is preferred. Situations where the ISO code might be useful typically involve accounting systems, exchange rates with other currencies, and anything that might need some sort of standardized code."><meta data-rh="true" property="og:description" content="This glossary is divided in two sectionsAn open-source project and software (as in, “contributing to the Tezos protocol”)A peer-to-peer network of nodes maintaining a blockchain (as in “a Tezos node”)The specific Tezos chain with the most economic relevance (as in “the Tezos chain”).
